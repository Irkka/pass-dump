# pass-dump

Utility to dump all your passwords into an unencrypted file and respectively restoring them from that file. Main use case would be to migrate your .password-store contents to another encryption key.

## Rationale

pass-dump resolves my niche problem and works as a tutorial for writing package manifests for AUR.
